Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your feedback. Here is the working CI/CD pipeline with all the requested information:

PUBLIC REPOSITORY URL:
https://github.com/Saad-alsaleh87/UdacityProject4

GITHUB ACTIONS URL (to analyze all job runs):
https://github.com/Saad-alsaleh87/UdacityProject4/actions

LIVE DEPLOYED APPLICATIONS:

Frontend Application:
http://ae69d9026ae87434a942068173f7a006-997290690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Backend API:
http://aa8634e3d563c4052a71f0b2626c3442-1813112696.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:3000/movies

CI/CD WORKFLOWS:
All 4 workflows are working and visible in the GitHub Actions page:
✅ Frontend Continuous Integration (frontend-ci.yaml)
✅ Frontend Continuous Deployment (frontend-cd.yaml)
✅ Backend Continuous Integration (backend-ci.yaml)
✅ Backend Continuous Deployment (backend-cd.yaml)

The repository is PUBLIC, so you can:
- Analyze all workflow runs and job executions directly
- View all workflow files in .github/workflows/
- See ECR push and EKS deployment steps in the CD workflows
- Verify the complete CI/CD pipeline implementation

EVIDENCE:
All evidence and detailed documentation is available at:
https://github.com/Saad-alsaleh87/UdacityProject4/blob/main/REVIEWER-EVIDENCE.md

HOW TO VERIFY:
1. Visit the GitHub Actions URL to see all successful workflow runs
2. Open the Frontend URL in your browser - you'll see the movie collection app
3. Test the Backend API URL with curl or browser - it returns JSON with 5 movies
4. Both applications are live and communicating successfully

All project requirements have been met and are verifiable through the working URLs and public repository.

Thank you!
